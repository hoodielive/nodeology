MongoDB stores data in collections which contain records 


User Collections are json/objects - (key value pairs) 

{
	id: 1, 
	name: "khu",
	height: 150

} 


and it is ..schema(less) meaning all collections are different. They don't have the same properties which differs from SQL dbs which require everything be uniform (id, name, email, address, etc) 

mongoose
Mongodb -> collection -> records -> properties of those records/objects 
Mongoose -> modelClass (represents an entire collection of mongodb) -> ModelInstance (represents single records inside of collection)
