What can I create with NodeJS?

- Anything that you can with any scripting language like: Python, Ruby but you're doing it with Javascript

Follow Node: 
* Tooling (build, automation,e t c)
* API(s)[Rest, Realtime, e t c]
* CDNs 
* Shareable libraries
* Desktop Applications -> Electron, SW.js, E T C
* IoT - johnny5
* Pretty much anything because node is on everything now

# Best way to install 
- nvm 

# Browser vs Node

Browser::
- Build interactive apps for 'web'
- DOM
- Window

Node::
- Build 'server' side apps and scripts 
- No GUI (can virtualize)
- No window, but does have a global object (Doesn't mean you should attach shiii to it)
