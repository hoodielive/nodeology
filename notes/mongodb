MongoDB stores data in collections which contain records 


User Collections are json/objects - (key value pairs) 

{
	id: 1, 
	name: "khu",
	height: 150

} 


and it is ..schema(less) meaning all collections are different. They don't have the same properties which differs from SQL dbs which require everything be uniform (id, name, email, address, etc)
